Library Management System in C


This program is a simple library management system written in C. It allows users to add, lend, return, and view books in a library.

Functionality
The program has the following functionality:

Add books: Admin can add books to the library by entering book name, number, and status.

Lend books: Students can borrow books from the library by entering the book name. If the book is available, it will be issued to the student and its status will be updated.

Return books: Students can return the books they borrowed by entering the book name. If the book is returned successfully, its status will be updated.

View books: Students can view all the books in the library along with their name, number, and status.

How to Use
To run the program, compile it using a C compiler such as gcc.

When the program is executed, the user is prompted to choose between three options: Admin, Student, and Exit.

If the user chooses Admin, they will be prompted to enter the Admin ID and Password. If the entered details are correct, they will be granted access to the Admin menu, where they can add books.

If the user chooses Student, they will be prompted to choose between four options: Lend books, Return books, View books, and Exit. Based on their choice, they can perform the corresponding action.
